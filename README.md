I'm Big Jeff The Chef

I completed my BSc Genetics in 2009 and worked as a lab tech for over a decade. Wasn't really commited to that career and now
I have fallen back in love with programming. Currently studying an MSc Software Development.

I had a little web dev experience from circa 2003, did some HTML, CSS and ASP. Created a fully functioning website with a login system
using an MS Access database back in the day, and created a website for an Architect's firm.

Looking forward to the future now! I'm trying to learn as much programming as possible!

Dabbling in some MERN stack web dev too.
